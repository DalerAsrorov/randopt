# Contributing to Randopt

First of all, thanks for your interest in contributing to Randopt.
In order to make your experience as smooth as possible, here's the recommended workflow for adding your desired functionality to Randopt.

1. **Open an issue**: To discuss the best way to implement your functionality.
2. **Implement your functionality**: Typically, in your own branch/fork of the current `master`.
3. **Write Unit Tests**: Using Python's unittest library.
4. **Document your code**: Using docstrings, so that documentation pages are automatically generated using `gendocs.py`. (See the [Experiment Class](https://github.com/seba-1511/randopt/blob/wiki/randopt/experiment/experiment.py#L90) for an example.)
5. **Write a wiki page**: (optional) If your functionality requires further explanations, feel free to write a short tutorial page on how to use it.
